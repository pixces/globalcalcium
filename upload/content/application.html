<p>The wide product range of Global Calcium commercialised since its incorporation, 30 years ago, have a wide variety of applications extending for oral and injectable pharmaceuticals to food fortification and high end cosmeceuticals.</p>
<p>Global Calcium has spearheaded its growth in recent years by focussing on the end product applications of its products and to this effort has set up a full fledged applications laboratory manned by competent scientists and food technologists.
 </p>
<p>While product applications in the pharmaceutical field are run of the mill development for us, and our products used by our customers in Effervescent tablets, ready to drink powders and high concentration vials for oral use, we are exceptionally proud of our recent activities in the food fortification.</p>
<p>We at Global Calcium have successfully developed products for fortification of common foodstuffs such as bread, milk using our highly soluble mineral compounds. The use of these high solubility, neutral tasting fortifying agents allows for reduced usage of chemicals for taste masking and enhances the concentrations of bio-deliverable minerals.</p>
<p>Another of our application research initiatives has been the development of cosmetic formulations for hydration of the skin using our highly soluble Mineral polyhydroxy acid complexes. The end products from this development project have been clinically tested and validated by numerous dermatology experts to improve the hydration levels of the human skin and thereby used for alleviation of various symptoms caused by loss of hydration levels in the skin.</p>
<p> For the future we have clearly identified our route map to develop novel applications and use these applications to spearhead the development of specifically suited novel actives for our clients.</p>
